# morpho-steak-cli

Welcome to the morpho-steak-cli python project! This README will guide you through setting up your development environment to ensure you're working with the correct version of Python and isolated environments for dependencies. We'll be using Python 3.11 and a virtual environment for this setup.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11**: Ensure Python 3.11 is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Step 1: Clone the Project Repository from Github

## Step 2: Creating the Virtual Environment

Creating a virtual environment (`venv`) for our project is essential for managing dependencies separately from other projects.

- Navigate to the main project directory in your terminal
- Create the virtual environment named `venv` using Python 3.11 with the following command:
  `python3.11 -m venv venv`
